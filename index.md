    <h1> The engine for real-time ML</h1>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <p>Kaskada is a query engine for event-based data designed for building & operating real-time ML models.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row mt-5">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Native time travel</h3>
            <p>Revisit the result of any feature at any point in time.</p>
            <p>Use the same query languge to define <i>what</i> to compute and to <i>when</i> to compute it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Instant exploration</h3>
            <p>Generate ML features directly from raw events.</p>
            <p>Safely downsample results with input slicing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Temporal joins</h3>
            <p>Compute point-in-time operations between differently-grouped results.</p>
            <p>Combine results defined at different times as continuous values.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Fast results</h3>
            <p>Compute engine implemented in Rust for performance and safety.</p>
            <p>Computation is built on Apache Arrow for speedy CPU utilization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Unified queries</h3>
            <p>Execute the same query in batch mode over historical data or in incremental mode over real-time streams.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Real-time, but with history</h3>
            <p>Transparently bootstrap real-time features with the full history of raw events.</p>
            <p>Continuously materialize features for real-time inference</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2> Why Kaskada</h2>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>Kaskada unifies historical and real-time data processing, allowing practitioners to instantly reconstruct the historical results of a query and then deploy the same query as a live materialization without losing historical context.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>Kaskadaâ€™s unique capabilities are the result of its time-aware query abstractions, a high-performance compute engine, and a configurable execution model supporting bulk and real-time data processing.</p>
